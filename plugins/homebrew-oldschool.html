<h2>Adding Homebrew Choices to Quilvyn's OldSchool Rule Sets</h2>

<p>
The OldSchool rule sets allow you to add homebrew choices to all of the same
types discussed in the <a href="homebrew-osric.html">OSRIC Homebrew Examples
document</a>. In addition, when The Complete Psionics Handbook supplement is
selected, the rule sets also allow you to add homebrew disciplines and powers.

<p>
Factions add new goals to character motivation in Pathfinder Society play.
Adding a homebrew faction requires only specifying the name.
</p><p>
The example shows entries for a Galtan faction&mdash;perhaps a group whose goal
is to export revolution to the rest of the Inner Sea region.

<p>
Traits describe small customizations that help to expand character backgrounds
and motivations. When entering a homebrew trait, Quilvyn provides entry fields
for the trait type (Basic, Campaign, Faction, Race, Regional, or Religion),
and subtype.
</p><p>
The example shows entries for the Child Of Infamy campaign trait from the
Council of Thieves Player's Guide and the entries for the corresponding feature.
